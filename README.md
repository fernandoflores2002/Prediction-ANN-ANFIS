# Prediction-ANN-ANFIS

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS). The project demonstrates the integration of data analysis, neural network modeling, and fuzzy logic techniques to predict results based on experimental data. This approach is commonly used in various scientific and engineering applications where data-driven predictions are necessary.

## Files

- **anfis_ejm.py**: A custom Python library implementing the ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) model. This file contains functions for training and predicting using the ANFIS model.
  
- **DATA.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that provides a detailed analysis of the project, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It serves as a step-by-step guide for replicating the results and understanding the underlying methodology.
  
- **data_isotermas.xlsx**: An Excel file containing experimental data related to isotherms. This data is used to train the models and validate the predictions made by the ANFIS and ANN models.
  
- **TrabajoFinal.pdf**: A comprehensive report that documents the project, including methodology, experimental setup, results, and conclusions. This file provides a deeper understanding of the project and its implications.
